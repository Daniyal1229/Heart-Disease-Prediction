# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of a heart disease prediction system using machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression. Logistic regression is a widely-used classification algorithm that can effectively predict the presence or absence of a certain outcome based on input features.

The key objectives of this project are:

Collect and preprocess the heart disease dataset.
Build a logistic regression model using Python libraries such as scikit-learn.
Train the model on the dataset and evaluate its performance.
Create an intuitive user interface for interacting with the trained model.
